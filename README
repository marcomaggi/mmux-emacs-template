1. Introduction
---------------

This is  a template project, to  be used as starting  point for packages
that implement a GNU Emacs module on top of a C11 language library.

  The library targets POSIX systems.  This package is meant to work with
GNU Emacs version 26+.  To run the test suite: this package requires the
ERT package.

  The package uses the GNU Autotools  and it is tested, using Travis CI,
on both Ubuntu  GNU+Linux systems and OS X systems.   The package relies
on "pkg-config" to find the dependencies installed on the system.

3. Install
----------

First make sure that your GNU Emacs installation has enabled support for
dynamic modules.   Check the elisp variable  "module-file-suffix": if it
is  set  to  nil, modules  are  disabled  and  we  need to  rebuild  and
reinstall the GNU Emacs package.

  To install from a proper release tarball, do this:

    $ cd mmux-emacs-template-0.1.0
    $ mkdir build
    $ cd build
    $ ../configure
    $ make
    $ make check
    $ make install

to inspect the available configuration options:

    $ ../configure --help

  The Makefile is designed to allow parallel builds, so we can do:

   $ make -j4 all && make -j4 check

which,  on  a  4-core  CPU,   should  speed  up  building  and  checking
significantly.

  The  Makefile supports  the  DESTDIR environment  variable to  install
files in a temporary location, example: to see what will happen:

    $ make -n install DESTDIR=/tmp/mmux-emacs-template

to really do it:

    $ make install DESTDIR=/tmp/mmux-emacs-template

  After the installation it is  possible to verify the installed library
against the test suite with:

    $ make installcheck

  From  a repository  checkout or  snapshot  (the ones  from the  GitHub
site): we  must install the  GNU Autotools (GNU Automake,  GNU Autoconf,
GNU Libtool),  then we must first  run the script "autogen.sh"  from the
top source directory, to generate the needed files:

    $ cd mmux-emacs-template
    $ sh autogen.sh

notice  that  "autogen.sh"  will   run  the  programs  "autoreconf"  and
"libtoolize"; the  latter is  selected through the  environment variable
"LIBTOOLIZE",  whose  value  can  be  customised;  for  example  to  run
"glibtoolize" rather than "libtoolize" we do:

   $ LIBTOOLIZE=glibtoolize sh autogen.sh

  After this the  procedure is the same  as the one for  building from a
proper release tarball, but we have to enable maintainer mode:

    $ ../configure --enable-maintainer-mode [options]
    $ make
    $ make check
    $ make install

  The  C  language shared  library  is  installed under  "$libdir",  for
example:

			    /usr/local/lib64

while the Emacs code goes under "$lispdir", for example:

		    /usr/local/share/emacs/site-lisp

so to load the module we should do something like:

   (add-to-list 'load-path "/usr/local/lib64"
                           "/usr/local/share/emacs/site-lisp")
   (require 'mmux-emacs-template)


4. Usage
--------

Read the documentation generated from  the Texinfo sources.  The package
installs the documentation  in Info format; we can  generate and install
documentation in HTML format by running:

   $ make html
   $ make install-html


A. Credits
----------

The  stuff was  written by  Marco Maggi.   If this  package exists  it's
because of the great GNU software tools that he uses all the time.


B. Bugs, vulnerabilities and contributions

D. Badges and static analysis
-----------------------------

D.1 Travis CI
-------------

Travis CI is  a hosted, distributed continuous  integration service used
to build and test software projects  hosted at GitHub.  We can find this
project's dashboard at:

	 <https://travis-ci.org/marcomaggi/mmux-emacs-template>

  Usage of this service is configured through the file ".travis.yml" and
the scripts under the directory "meta/travis-ci".


D.2 Clang's Static Analyzer
---------------------------

The Clang Static Analyzer is a source code analysis tool that finds bugs
in C, C++, and Objective-C programs.  It is distributed along with Clang
and we can find it at:

		   <http://clang-analyzer.llvm.org/>

  Usage of this service is implemented with make rules; see the relevant
section in the file "Makefile.am".


D.3 Codecov
-----------

Codecov is a service providing code  coverage reports.  We can find this
project's dashboard at:

	 <https://codecov.io/gh/marcomaggi/mmux-emacs-template>

Usage of  this service is  implemented through direct  interface between
GitHub and Codecov  sites; it configured through  the file `codecov.yml`
and appropriate entries in Travis CI's matrix of builds.


D.4 Codacy
----------

Codacy is  an online service  providing code  review.  We can  find this
project's dashboard at:

      <https://www.codacy.com/app/marcomaggi/mmux-emacs-template>

Usage of this service is  implemented through direct integration between
GitHub and Codacy sites.
