## Introduction

This is  a template project, to  be used as starting  point for packages
that implement a GNU Emacs module on top of a C11 language library.

The library targets  POSIX systems.  This package is meant  to work with
GNU Emacs version 26+.  This package depends upon the external packages:
cl-lib.  To run the test suite: this package requires the ERT package.

The package uses the GNU Autotools and it is tested, using Travis CI, on
both Ubuntu GNU+Linux  systems and OS X systems.  The  package relies on
`pkg-config` to find the dependencies installed on the system.

## Install

First make sure that your GNU Emacs installation has enabled support for
dynamic modules.   Check the elisp variable  `module-file-suffix': if it
is set to nil, modules are disabled and we need to rebuild and reinstall
the GNU Emacs package.

To install from a proper release tarball, do this:

```
$ cd mmux-emacs-template-0.1.0
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ ../configure
$ make
$ make check
$ make install
```

to inspect the available configuration options:

```
$ ../configure --help
```

The Makefile is designed to allow parallel builds, so we can do:

```
$ make -j4 all && make -j4 check
```

which,  on  a  4-core  CPU,   should  speed  up  building  and  checking
significantly.

The Makefile supports the DESTDIR  environment variable to install files
in a temporary location, example: to see what will happen:

```
$ make -n install DESTDIR=/tmp/mmux-emacs-template
```

to really do it:

```
$ make install DESTDIR=/tmp/mmux-emacs-template
```

After the  installation it is  possible to verify the  installed library
against the test suite with:

```
$ make installcheck
```

From a repository checkout or snapshot  (the ones from the Github site):
we  must install  the GNU  Autotools  (GNU Automake,  GNU Autoconf,  GNU
Libtool), then  we must first run  the script `autogen.sh` from  the top
source directory, to generate the needed files:

```
$ cd mmux-emacs-template
$ sh autogen.sh

```

notice  that  `autogen.sh`  will   run  the  programs  `autoreconf`  and
`libtoolize`; the  latter is  selected through the  environment variable
`LIBTOOLIZE`,  whose  value  can  be  customised;  for  example  to  run
`glibtoolize` rather than `libtoolize` we do:

```
$ LIBTOOLIZE=glibtoolize sh autogen.sh
```

After this  the procedure  is the same  as the one  for building  from a
proper release tarball, but we have to enable maintainer mode:

```
$ ../configure --enable-maintainer-mode [options]
$ make
$ make check
$ make install
```

The C language shared library is installed under `$libdir`, for example:

```
/usr/local/lib64
```

while the Emacs code goes under `$lispdir`, for example:

```
/usr/local/share/emacs/site-lisp
```

so to load the module we should do something like:

```
(add-to-list 'load-path "/usr/local/lib64"
                        "/usr/local/share/emacs/site-lisp")
(require 'mmux-emacs-template)
```

## Usage

Read the documentation generated from  the Texinfo sources.  The package
installs the documentation  in Info format; we can  generate and install
documentation in HTML format by running:

```
$ make html
$ make install-html
```

## Credits

The  stuff was  written by  Marco Maggi.   If this  package exists  it's
because of the great GNU software tools that he uses all the time.

## Bugs, vulnerabilities and contributions

Bug  and vulnerability  reports are  appreciated, all  the vulnerability
reports  are  public; register  them  using  the  Issue Tracker  at  the

## Badges and static analysis

### Travis CI

Travis CI is  a hosted, distributed continuous  integration service used
to build and test software projects  hosted at GitHub.  We can find this
project's dashboard at:

[https://travis-ci.org/marcomaggi/mmux-emacs-template](https://travis-ci.org/marcomaggi/mmux-emacs-template)

Usage of this  service is configured through the  file `.travis.yml` and
additional scripts are under the directory `meta/travis-ci`.

### Clang's Static Analyzer

The Clang Static Analyzer is a source code analysis tool that finds bugs
in C, C++, and Objective-C programs.  It is distributed along with Clang
and we can find it at:

[http://clang-analyzer.llvm.org/](http://clang-analyzer.llvm.org/)

Usage of this  service is implemented with make rules;  see the relevant
section in the file `Makefile.am`.

### Codecov

Codecov is a service providing code  coverage reports.  We can find this
project's dashboard at:

[https://codecov.io/gh/marcomaggi/mmux-emacs-template](https://codecov.io/gh/marcomaggi/mmux-emacs-template)

Usage of  this service is  implemented through direct  interface between
GitHub and Codecov  sites; it configured through  the file `codecov.yml`
and appropriate entries in Travis CI's matrix of builds.

### Codacy

Codacy is  an online service  providing code  review.  We can  find this
project's dashboard at:

[https://www.codacy.com/app/marcomaggi/mmux-emacs-template](https://www.codacy.com/app/marcomaggi/mmux-emacs-template)

Usage of this service is  implemented through direct integration between
GitHub and Codacy sites.
